# Myntra-Clone

A Myntra clone typically refers to a website or application that replicates the functionality and features of Myntra, an Indian e-commerce platform specializing in fashion and lifestyle products. Creating a Myntra clone would involve developing similar features such as user accounts, product listings, shopping carts, payment gateways, order management, and perhaps additional functionalities like recommendations, reviews, and personalized user experiences. Creating a clone allows developers to leverage the successful model of an existing platform while customizing it to their own needs and preferences.
